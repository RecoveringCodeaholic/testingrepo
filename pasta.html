            <h2>Description</h2>
            This homemade pasta recipe is our new favorite cooking project! Lately, Jack and I have been spending even more time than usual in the kitchen, experimenting with bread, baked goods, and even okonomiyaki. But we keep coming back to homemade pasta. It’s super fun to make together, and it only requires a handful of basic ingredients. Of course, the fact that it’s absolutely delicious doesn’t hurt either.
                 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li>Eggs </li>
                    <li>Olive oil </li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol> 

            <li> Step 1: First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface.</li>
            <li> Step 2: Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.
            </li>
            <li> Step 3: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.
            </li>
            <li> Step 4: Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
            </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            It was at a New York City hole-in-the-wall eatery where I first fell in love with a stuffed white corn cake. Halfway through my first arepa, one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, and salty cheese, I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your favorite fillings. I went with some spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li>2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N.®) </li>
                    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed </li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol> 

            <li> Step 1: Stir water and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.
            </li>
            <li> Step 2: Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.
            </li>
            <li> Step 3: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.
            </li>
            <li> Step 4: Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
            </li>
            </ol>
